To play this game, run the *main.py* file.

9 different cowboys will peak up over the sandbars they take cover behind. 
Your job is to shoot them when they peak up,  done by clicking them, but not the sandbars they hide behind. 
Doing so scores 10 points per shot. 
After 6 shots, you will be forced to reload, which is done by clicking the big R button on the HUD.
At a random point in the game's cycle, a can of Heinz Beans will come flying from offscreen, at the top of the screen, from left to right, preceded by a warning. Shoot this high-velocity can to earn a ton of points.
After 60 seconds, the game will automatically end, printing your total score to the terminal.
