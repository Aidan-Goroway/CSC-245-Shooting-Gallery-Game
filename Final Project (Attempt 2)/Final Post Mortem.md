Well. That was an experience. Let's go over the details.


**What went well?**

**The start.**
Right out of the gate, I had the identity of my game decided and was creating assets for it. By the first night I had the skeletal structure done with and was working on the finer details.

**Art design.**
Saying the art design went well might be cheating because all of it is either made in MS Paint or shopped together from real images. On that note, this thing breaks copyright law like a champ. Even the music and sound effects are stolen.

**The Second Attempt.**
I can categorize this as its own positive point purely for the benefits that came with starting again fresh. The organization improved almost immediately, code was more understandable, and work started getting done faster. As for why I had to restart to begin with, that will be explained later.

  

**What went poorly?**

The portion after starting but before *re*-starting.
The way I went about writing my code for the sake of a demo was at first understandable and simple enough. As progress continued, basic features I intended to implement became increasingly difficult to work with.

**My demo.**
The demo would have gone well (ignoring my late entry into class), but a major issue became apparent: the size of my game (screen size specifically) and all its assets were far too big for the screen of an average laptop.

**Scope.**
The biggest issue with my game is that most of what I pitched on the design document simply did not appear. Large variety of targets? 2 different object types, 10 total targets. Randomized appearances? Only a few, really. Dynamic strategy? Unload 6 shots into a single target, reload while they shuffle, and make sure to hit the can. I will go into detail about this later, but a longer development time would rectify a lot of the missing content issues.

**Overall Breakdown of events.**

I feel as if the words said thus far do not serve as proper context for what really happened, so I will elaborate here. Let's start with a few other details I have not mentioned. For this project, I opted to work alone, so I could keep complete track of what had and had not been done, as well as keep my creative vision uncompromised. At least, the only thing compromising my vision was myself anyway. I do not believe that working alone had any adverse effects on my project, as it was always small in scale, even during its initial pitch. The biggest problem with this project became apparent soon after starting it: I am not very experienced with freelance game making. At the time of starting my project, I had still yet to grasp the essentials of Python’s classes, and so I opted to not use them. This would make adding additional features exponentially harder. A bug where each cowboy would stay shot even when resetting position proved itself unsquashable, so that remained in the demo. Afterwards, I made the decision to completely start the project over, shrinking the assets to work on smaller screens, and forcing myself to use the still-unfamiliar class system. After a lot of trial and error, this proved to be a much better approach, and progress sped up again. It soon became apparent that even acknowledging the newfound speed of progress, filling my game with unique targets was not feasible in the span of a week. This is before factoring in the fact that it's finals week. So I cut down on nearly every idea I had, and what you see is what you get. If I were to restart the project, I would set no deadline and use only original art assets. Using classes goes without saying.

Among other things, I learned that no matter how simple you make your goal, it will always multiply in complexity to an unpredictable degree. Learning how to better use classes also serves as an important detail to me, seeing as I have been trying to understand them for the better part of the entire term.
